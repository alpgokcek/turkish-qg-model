	\section{Project Name}
	
	Turkish Question Generation Model
	

	\section{Project Summary (Abstract)}
	
	Question Generation is a Deep Learning model that given a paragraph, passage or an entity in Turkish, produces the possible questions that can be answered solely by the given content to the system. Question Generation(QG) Systems are capable of generating various logical questions from the given text input. QG Systems are prevalent in several computer applications such as chatbots, automated grading systems etc.\newline \par
	
	In this project, our aim is to train different deep learning models for question generation and assess their performances. We find this task worth tackling since there are not many examples of comprehensive studies on the topic and the outcomes of this project will empower the development of more capable-than-ever Question Answering Systems for the Turkish Language. \newline \par
	
	QG models require extensively large training data, thus, in the last semester we have developed the initial dataset for the development of the QG model. This dataset is the largest Turkish Question Answer dataset currently available. In this semester, we also aim to improve the diversity of our dataset to generate questions in larger extent. \newline \par

	\section{Hardware and Software Requirements}
	
	\begin{itemize}[label=\textcolor{darkazure}{\Large\textbullet}]
		\item GPU Optimized Server. Will be used for training deep learning models, storing large amounts of data and as a collaborative environment.
		
		\item UNIX Based Environment(s). Given the design and integration of de-facto programming languages, frameworks, tools with Unix based operating systems, along with the flexibility and low-level tools it has to offer, we concluded that UNIX based operating systems will be most suitable for the development process.
		
		\item Dataset.  Contains Turkish paragraphs, related questions and their answers.
	\end{itemize}
